## Building Multi-Tool Voice AI Agents with ElevenLabs

Voice AI agents are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex operations through tool integration. This guide explains how to build a voice agent that can independently access multiple tools and make decisions based on conversation context.

## Core Architecture

The system combines several key components:
- ElevenLabs for voice interaction
- Vector database for information retrieval
- Google Calendar for appointment management
- Google Sheets for data storage
- Webhook system for tool orchestration

## Implementation

### 1. ElevenLabs Voice Agent Setup
1. Create new agent in ElevenLabs Conversational AI
2. Configure initial greeting message
3. Set system prompt with tool definitions:
```
You are a support agent with access to:
- Calendar for checking appointment availability
- Vector database for retrieving information
- Google Sheets for storing customer data
```
4. Configure webhook URL for external tool access
5. Select GPT-4 or similar model for comprehensive tool understanding

### 2. Vector Database Configuration
1. Prepare knowledge base documents
2. Process documents into embeddings
3. Store in vector database (e.g., Pinecone)
4. Configure query endpoint
5. Test retrieval with sample queries

### 3. Calendar Integration
1. Set up Google Calendar API access
2. Create dedicated calendar for appointments
3. Configure availability checking endpoint
4. Set up appointment creation endpoint
5. Implement email notification system

### 4. Customer Data Storage
1. Create Google Sheet with columns:
   - Name
   - Phone
   - Email
   - Appointment Time
   - Notes
2. Configure Google Sheets API access
3. Set up data append endpoint

### 5. Webhook Setup
1. Create main webhook endpoint
2. Configure path: `/voice-agent`
3. Accept POST requests
4. Expected payload format:
```
{
  "query": "user's request",
  "context": {
    "name": "user name",
    "phone": "phone number"
  }
}
```

### 6. Tool Router Configuration
1. Create central routing logic
2. Define intent patterns:
   - Appointment related: "schedule", "book", "availability"
   - Information queries: "what", "how", "tell me about"
   - Contact storage: "save", "store", "remember"
3. Map intents to appropriate tools
4. Set up error handling and fallbacks

### 7. Response Management
1. Format tool responses for voice output
2. Structure conversational flow:
   - Acknowledgment
   - Tool operation
   - Confirmation
   - Next steps
3. Handle multi-turn conversations
4. Implement context retention

### 8. Testing & Validation
1. Test individual tool connections
2. Verify voice quality and response time
3. Test end-to-end conversation flows:
   - Information retrieval
   - Appointment booking
   - Contact storage
4. Validate error handling
5. Test concurrent operations

## Best Practices

### Voice Interaction
- Keep responses concise but complete
- Include verbal confirmations for important actions
- Provide clear next steps
- Handle interruptions gracefully

### Tool Integration
- Implement timeouts for all external calls
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Log all tool operations
- Monitor API usage and limits

### Security
- Implement authentication for all endpoints
- Validate all incoming data
- Sanitize data before storage
- Regular security audits

### Maintenance
- Monitor conversation logs
- Track failed tool operations
- Update knowledge base regularly
- Refine intent matching patterns
